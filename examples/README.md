# Autometrics Examples

This directory contains various examples showing off how to use different autometrics features and integrations.

You can run each of the examples with:
```shell
cargo run --package example-{name of example}
```

## Basic Examples

- [axum](./axum) - Use autometrics to instrument HTTP handlers
- [custom-metrics](./custom-metrics/) - Define your own custom metrics alongside the ones generated by autometrics (using any of the metrics collection crates)
- [tracing](./tracing/) - Use the `trace_id` from `tracing::Span`s as Prometheus exemplars

## Full Example

Look at the [full-api](./full-api) example to see autometrics in use in an example API server built with `axum`, `thiserror`, and `tokio`.
