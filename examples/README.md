# Autometrics Examples

This directory contains various examples showing off how to use different autometrics features and integrations.

You can run each of the examples with:
```shell
cargo run --package example-{name of example}
```

## Basic Examples

- [axum](./axum) - Use autometrics to instrument HTTP handlers
- [custom-metrics](./custom-metrics/) - Define your own custom metrics alongside the ones generated by autometrics (using any of the metrics collection crates)
- [exemplars-tracing](./exemplars-tracing/) - Use fields from `tracing::Span`s as Prometheus exemplars

## Full Example

Look at the [full-api](./full-api) example to see autometrics in use in an example API server built with `axum`, `thiserror`, and `tokio`.

## Prometheus

If Prometheus is installed locally example may start it as needed. You can also start Prometheus before running examples with Docker like this:

```
# from this directory
docker run  -v $(pwd)/util/prometheus.yml:/prometheus/prometheus.yml --network host prom/prometheus --enable-feature=exemplar-storage
```
