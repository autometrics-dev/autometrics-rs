# Autometrics Examples

This directory contains various examples showing off how to use different autometrics features and integrations.

## Basic Examples

- [alerts](./alerts) - Generate Prometheus alerting rules for autometrics-annotated functions
- [custom metrics](./custom-metrics/) - Define your own custom metrics alongside the ones generated by autometrics (using any of the metrics collection crates)

## Full Example

Look at the [full API](./full-api) example to see autometrics in use in an example API server built with `axum`, `clap`, and `thiserror`.
