// We could move more or all of the code into the macro itself.
// However, the compiler would need to compile a lot of duplicate code in every
// instrumented function. It's also harder to develop and maintain macros with
// too much generated code, because rust-analyzer treats the macro code as a kind of string
// so you don't get any autocompletion or type checking.
